    <string name="rules">Game:
You get a pair of words. In order to win, you have to transform the former word to the latter one by 7 steps.
Rules:
On each step you have to transform the previous word by one of the following:
1. Changing the letters\' position.
For instance, the word "team" can be transformed to "meat", "tame" or "mate".
2. Adding/deleting one of the letters.
For instance, the word "mate" can be changed to "mates" or "mat". Thus, "meat" -> "mates".
3. Changing one of the letters: "team" -> "teem"
Also, you can do all the three actions simultaneously: "team" -> "meets"
Examples:
     Word    Day      Boy
     Row     Way      Bay
     Bow     Weak    May
     Book    Week    Man

Those are relatively simple transformations, it must be much tougher. Are you ready to get in?</string>
